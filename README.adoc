## Neo4j Dump File Tracking

Neo4j dump files stored in `neo4j/import` are tracked using [git lfs](https://git-lfs.com/).
To version control the dump file, you must install git-lfs for your system and initialize
it for your current user. [Install instructions are found here](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs?tab=readme-ov-file#installing):

## Pre-requisites
- Install Docker Desktop version >= 4.27 ([Official Page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))

Install git lfs:

- [For Mac using brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/git-lfs#default)
- [For Debian/Ubuntu using apt](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/INSTALLING.md)

Initialize git lfs:

```sh
git lfs install
```

```
We are using git large file storage, so the database is part of the repository.
Getting the latest version of the database:
```sh
git lfs fetch
git lfs checkout
```
You must also import the database
```sh
cd neo4j
python3 import.py
```
If you go to the Neo4j interface, you should see Deployment and Environment Node types, which will track URLs for s3url and mockshop site.
## Starting Services

The frontend vueapp is ran directly by the developer using `npm run dev`. See
[vueApp README.md](vueApp/app/README.md) for more information. However, there
is a fixed deployment option that does not require node.js to be installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - all docker compose scripts must be executed from the root of the graph project
> - precomputed `DOCKER_UID` and `DOCKER_GID` values may be saved to a .env file and omitted

### Fixed Deployment

Start all services:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```

Shut down all services:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml down
```

### Development Deployment

Start all services:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```

Shut down all services:

```sh
docker compose down
```

### Cleanup Docker Resources

You may clean up docker resources that are no longer used automatically using
the cli.

> [!NOTE]
> You will be prompted by each command to confirm the action

To clean docker images:

```sh
docker image prune
```

To clean docker volumes:

```sh
docker volume prune
```

## Access to Resources

| Service       | URI                                     |
| :--           | ---                                     |
| Neo4j Proxy   | [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) |
| Neo4j Backend | [localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474) |

## Neo4j Development Data

> [!WARNING]
> - you must have started services at least once using the above methods
> - both commands require the working directory to be `./neo4j`

### Upload Dump

1. Ask the team to provide you the
    latest neo4j dump file, typically hosted in our shared Teams Folder.
2. Save the dump file in `./neo4j/import`
3. Run below commands:

```sh
python import.py
```

### Export Dump

The export script will dump the existing database of the compose instance to
the `./neo4j/export` directory. To the commands:

```sh
python export.py
```
